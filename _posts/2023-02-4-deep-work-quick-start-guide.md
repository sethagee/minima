## An overview of Deep Work

In this article, I give an overview of my own implementation of the most powerful tool for increasing productivity I have ever put into practice: Deep Work. The additional appeal of Deep Work is its absolute simplicity:

> Deep Work: A state of being in which one focuses their entire cognitive energy upon a professional activity which is at or approaching their mental limits.

To put it into other words, we may think of Deep Work as complete focus upon a single task which is neither too easy nor impossible. These tasks are generally thought of as the things you do at your job or for your career. 

Cal Newport (author of "Deep Work") offers additional insight into what should qualify as Deep Work: Ask yourself, "How long would a new college graduate take to learn how to do this task well?" If your answer is a long amount of time (for example, learning how to do C++ programming or teaching linear algebra at the college level), it should qualify as Deep Work. Otherwise, do not label it as Deep Work (email, administrative work, and other tasks that require little focused attention fall into the bucket of "Shallow Work").

Despite this simplicity, deep work can be difficult to implement, especially for those who are used to working in a haphazard or distracted manner. Let me give you a quick start guide that anyone can follow on their next work day to begin vastly improving their productivity.

## How to practice Deep Work

After choosing an appropriate task, you need to choose the amount of time you will dedicate your focus towards this task. It is important that this focus be unbroken for the duration of time chosen. Let's go more in depth.

### Focus over time

When practicing Deep Work, I am always on a timer. I refer to Deep Work done for a set period of time as a "Deep Work block". Without timing my Deep Work, I tend to take a break whenever I am uncomfortable with the task at hand, increasing the number of context switches and therefore lowering my amount of work output. When you are on the timer, you are focused on ONLY ONE task. No checking email, no unrelated conversations, no looking at your phone, and no switching to a different task. This may sound difficult, but you are allowed to choose the amount of time on the timer, and so breaks from focus should be built in to the system as needed. The key here is that when the timer is on, you are focused on the chosen task exclusively.

Usage of a timer additionally allows you to have metrics for tracking your productivity and cognition. Keep track of the total number of Deep Work hours per week, and you may begin to notice that your quality and volume of work increases as Deep Work hours increase (and the converse, as well). Keep track of the length of your Deep Work blocks and you can track your cognitive fitness. Are you only able to do Deep Work for 30 minutes at a time before getting fatigued? Work on pushing that number up, and watch your ability to think and produce value at your job go up with it.

If a task is finished in the middle of a Deep Work block, just move on to a new one. If interrupted or distracted, write down the amount of time completed and then restart the timer at the next available time. With this in mind, choosing an appropriate amount of time for your block should be done with care.

### Choosing Deep Work block times

There are many ways to choose the amount of time for your Deep Work blocks. Here is an overview of some methods of timing your Deep Work blocks:

#### Constant time intervals

My preferred method, in which I choose a set amount of time (90 minutes for example), put it on a timer, and only stop working when the timer has expired. This method works very well with time block planning (described in a section below), with tasks that tend to be difficult to estimate the length of time needed to complete, and with tasks are easily stopped and restarted. Good examples would include doing writing for a book, working on software bugs/features, or doing academic research.

#### Estimated or predetermined time intervals

In the case of tasks which are easily estimated or whose total time to complete is known to you prior, you may use that amount of time for your block. This case might include tasks such as teaching a class, collaborating with researchers, or meetings (where you are actively engaged and not asleep). In these scenarios, the timer is built in, but tracking should still be done.

#### Free form time intervals

This option may be used on time sensitive or critical tasks. The idea here is to start a timer and keep it running for as long as necessary to complete the task. The key is that no breaks are to be taken until the task is complete. This type of Deep Work block is best suited for situations where the task must be completed as soon as possible.

## Planning Deep Work in your day, week, and beyond

Planning on multiple scales has been invaluable in my implementation of Deep Work. If I know what my projects, goals, and requirements are for this quarter, I can use that to plan out what is done on a weekly basis. Once I have my week planned, each day can be divided into blocks of time that are put toward a specific goal. Quarterly, weekly, and daily planning keeps you on track and lets you properly assign your time during the day to whatever tasks are important to meet your goals.

Although I will not go over quarterly or weekly planning in this article, I will give a brief overview of my own daily planning routine that can be easily integrated into your work day:

- Step 1: Determine which tasks need to be worked on for the day.
- Step 2: Fill in all predetermined blocks of time on a half hourly basis (meetings, standup, lunch, etc.).
- Step 3: Fill in the leftover time with Deep Work blocks. Each block should have a task or tasks assigned to it that will be your focus for that block.

This method of partitioning your time into half hourly blocks, then assigning tasks to them is what is commonly referred to as "time blocking." Using this idea, you will always know exactly what tasks you should be working on at any given time. 

In the event that your schedule needs to moved or has been disrupted, take the next available moment to quickly rework your time blocks for the day. In this fashion, you have a dynamically updating schedule that keeps you on track even in the madness of everyday life. At the end of each day, tally up your Deep Work hours completed and store them for future use.

## Conclusion

Over the past several months, I have used the methods above to push my focus to new levels, improve my output of quality work and domain knowledge, and make my work life more organized and manageable. Work has become increasingly satisfying, and I know that I am putting in my very best effort to produce value for my employer. Using this system can remove the chaos from your work life and helps lower decision fatigue. It is my belief that this is the optimal system for anyone whose work is cognitively demanding.

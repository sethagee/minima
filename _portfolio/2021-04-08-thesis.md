## Description of Thesis

This is the work that led to my Master of Science in Mathematics, defended in April of 2021. The thesis is 85 pages
long, and took around 1.5 years to complete. I am forever grateful to my thesis advisor, Dr. Motoya Machida, and
everyone else who served on my committee.

This thesis lies somewhere in the intersection of applied and pure mathematics, bridging the highly abstract field
of probability and stochastic processes with finance. We take the first three chapters to introduce (in as much
detail as possible) the necessary theory. Chapter 4 introduces the classical Black-Scholes
model and equation, and then generalizes it.

### Title and Abstract

*Martingale Representation, Girsanov’s Theorem, and a Generalization of the Black-Scholes Model*

"In their influential work in options pricing, Black and Scholes derived the
theoretical call option premium price and showed that a strategy for eliminating risk
to the contract seller exists. The fundamental assumption was that the stock price
follows a geometric Brownian motion, thus allowing the premium to be calculated by
solving a partial differential equation. We give an alternative derivation, harnessing
the power of results in stochastic calculus. Under a change of measure on the underlying
probability space, we can transform the discounted stock price into a martingale,
then apply the martingale representation theorem to yield a unique representation
which gives rise to a replicating strategy. Using properties of Brownian motion, the
premium price can then be derived. We make further generalizations on the assumptions
of the model and achieve similar results."

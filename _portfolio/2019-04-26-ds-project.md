## Description of Project

In this project, with the help of four of my peers, we created an application for people putting pets up for adoption 
that shows them how they can improve their chances of having their pet get adopted. We used the 
[Kaggle PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/overview).

### Technical Details

In this project, my role was to research and select the best model for predicting how fast a pet would be adopted based
on our data. During my research, I explored many regression models (lasso, double lasso, lasso with thresholds), clustering
algorithms, and others. All analysis was done in R. If I had to go back into this project today, I would also like to test some classification algorithms on the data. 

In the end, our lasso regression with thresholds was chosen as our best option, though the predictions it gave were
not always very accurate. I believe that I could do much better on this project today, and may have to revisit it at
some point!

Overall, this was just a fun project that I was able to complete with a very good group of friends. We worked hard
and were able to build something good in a short period of time.

Machine learning, artificial intelligence, probability and stochastic processes, pure and applied mathematics, statistics, 
and the ability to communicate these highly advanced topics to the average person and apply them to solving real problems. 
These are the ideas that I live for each day, and hope to apply in my future career. How have these things been a part of my
life so far?

In my education as an undergraduate, I lived and breathed mathematics and statistics, and came to appreciate the power of 
computer programming. With honors, I earned my degree in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, and attained skills 
like C/C++ programming, SQL, data structures, algorithms, R programming, statistical analysis, advanced linear algebra, 
graph theory, and many more mathematics topics. During this time, I did an undergraduate research project using R to model 
highway speed data, earning a first place poster for Mathematics at the 2019 Research and Creative Inquiry Day.

During my time as a Master's student in mathematics, I further built my knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of modern 
mathematics, allowing me to quickly and easily synthesize new and highly theoretical topics. During this time I became an 
expert in probability and statistics, stochastic processes, abstract algebra, and mathematical analysis, ending my time with 
a 4.0 GPA. My thesis used the theory of stochastic processes to derive the Black-Scholes equation for pricing financial 
derivatives, and I gave several presentations on related topics. Deepening my understanding of statistical analysis and the 
ability to communicate mathematics, I taught two semesters of undergraduate statistics during this time as well.

After graduation, I was offered a temporary instructor position which I currently still hold. I have taught various courses 
in algebra, statistics, and pre-calculus, and my ability to turn complicated ideas into easily digestible content for the 
typical student has improved dramatically. I have also continued research on topics related to my Master's thesis during 
this time.

My most recent endeavors include learning Python and brushing up on my C and SQL skills so I can apply all my theoretical 
knowledge to solve real problems. I have also been taking several courses on machine learning, deep learning, cryptography, 
and Bayesian statistics.

In summary, if you are looking for someone with deep mathematical knowledge, great communication, and a deep desire to apply 
these to solve your problems, looks no further!

## Education and Experience Timeline

Machine learning, probability and stochastic processes, pure and applied mathematics, statistics, 
and the ability to communicate these advanced topics to the average person and apply them to solving real problems. 
These are the ideas that I live for each day, and hope to apply in my future career. How have these things been a part of my
life so far?

### Undergraduate 2015-2019

In my education as an undergraduate, I lived and breathed mathematics and statistics, and came to appreciate the power of 
computer programming. With honors, I earned my degree in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, and attained skills 
like C/C++ programming, SQL, data structures, algorithms, R programming, statistical analysis, advanced linear algebra, 
graph theory, and many more mathematical topics. During this time, I did an undergraduate research project using R to model 
highway speed data, earning a first place poster for Mathematics at the 2019 Research and Creative Inquiry Day.

### Graduate School 2019-2021

During my time as a Master's student in mathematics, I further built my knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of modern 
mathematics, allowing me to quickly and easily synthesize new and highly theoretical topics. During this time I became an 
expert in probability and statistics, stochastic processes, abstract algebra, and mathematical analysis, ending my time with 
a 4.0 GPA. My thesis used the theory of stochastic processes to derive the Black-Scholes equation for pricing financial 
derivatives, and I gave several presentations on related topics. Deepening my understanding of statistical analysis and the 
ability to communicate mathematics, I taught two semesters of undergraduate statistics during this time as well.

### Instructor of Mathematics 2021-Present

After graduation, I was offered a temporary instructor position which I currently still hold. I have taught various courses 
in algebra, statistics, and pre-calculus, and my ability to turn complicated ideas into easily digestible content for the 
typical student has improved dramatically.

In addition to my teaching, I continue to research mathematics, having weekly meetings with my graduate thesis advisor, Dr.
Motoya Machida, and I am also taking a course in mathematical cryptography. Outside of mathematics, I have been teaching myself
Python (and several packages), continue to learn R, and take online courses related to machine learning and data science.

### Future

In the near future, I hope to begin a new journey in the world of machine learning and data science. I believe I am a
great fit for the field, have passion to learn and grow, and will be a vital asset to any company who gives me an
oppurtunity to show them my capabilities.

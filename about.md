## Education and Experience Timeline

Here is an overview of my past, present, and future. 

### Undergraduate 2015-2019

In my education as an undergraduate, I lived and breathed mathematics and statistics, and came to appreciate the power of 
computer programming. With honors, I earned my degree in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, and attained skills 
like C/C++ programming, SQL, data structures, algorithms, R programming, statistical analysis, advanced linear algebra, 
graph theory, and many more mathematical topics. During this time, I did an undergraduate research project using R to model 
highway speed data, earning a first place poster for Mathematics at the 2019 Research and Creative Inquiry Day.

### Graduate School 2019-2021

During my time as a Master's student in mathematics, I further built my knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of modern 
mathematics, allowing me to quickly and easily synthesize new and highly theoretical topics. During this time I became an 
expert in probability and statistics, stochastic processes, abstract algebra, and mathematical analysis, ending my time with 
a 4.0 GPA. My thesis used the theory of stochastic processes to derive the Black-Scholes equation for pricing financial 
derivatives, and I gave several presentations on related topics. Deepening my understanding of statistical analysis and the 
ability to communicate mathematics, I taught two semesters of undergraduate statistics during this time as well.

### Instructor of Mathematics 2021-2022

After graduation, I was offered a temporary instructor position which I was very happy to accept. I have taught various courses 
in algebra, statistics, and pre-calculus, and my ability to turn complicated ideas into easily digestible content for the 
typical student saw great improvement.

In addition to my teaching, I continued to research mathematics, have weekly meetings with my graduate thesis advisor, Dr.
Motoya Machida, and took a course in mathematical cryptography. Outside of mathematics, I taught myself
Python (and several packages), some data science/machine learning, and made this website.

I look back on the many great experiences I had with students during this time as a great time in my life, and hope to continue to have opportunities 
to teach in the future.

### Dynetics 2022-Present

In 2022, I accepted a position as a scientist at Dynetics. I am enjoying my time here, solving difficult problems every day. I love being around so 
many smart, helpful, and overall good people, and look forward to a long stay with the company. In my past time I continue to self learn mathematics
and other interesting topics.

### Future

In the future I hope to continue to cultivate my passion for mathematics, and apply it wherever I can. I will continue to teach to whoever will listen 
(or can stand to listen). Much of my research efforts will be updated in the articles section.
